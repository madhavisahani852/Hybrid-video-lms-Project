# AI Talking Head Service

This service provides a REST API for submitting and tracking talking head avatar
generation jobs. It accepts a face image and audio file, validates inputs, stores
files safely, and dispatches a background pipeline task.

> **Note:** The repository is designed around the official `LatentSync`
> backend. The API keeps the existing `image_path` contract for compatibility,
> but the real official pipeline requires a short reference video plus audio as
> input. The service therefore produces a temporary reference video in the
> compatibility layer before handing off to the actual LatentSync pipeline.
>
> The actual model weights and runtime package are not committed to this
> repository, so the pipeline performs a controlled failure until the runtime and
> checkpoint are configured in the environment.

## Job Lifecycle

```
queued
  ↓
processing
  ↓
failed  (until real inference engine is integrated)
```

Once a real inference engine is integrated:
```
queued → processing → completed
```

A job will **never** be marked `completed` without a validated, real video output.

## Error Codes

| Code | HTTP Status | Meaning |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 400 | Generic validation failure |
| `EMPTY_FILE` | 400 | Uploaded file is empty |
| `FILE_TOO_LARGE` | 400 | File exceeds size limit |
| `UNSUPPORTED_IMAGE_FORMAT` | 400 | Image extension/MIME not allowed |
| `UNSUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMAT` | 400 | Audio extension not allowed |
| `CORRUPTED_IMAGE` | 400 | Image cannot be decoded |
| `CORRUPTED_AUDIO` | 400 | Audio magic header check failed |
| `UNSUPPORTED_MODEL` | 400 | Model not configured in this repository |
| `JOB_NOT_FOUND` | 404 | Job ID does not exist |
| `PIPELINE_ERROR` | 500 | Pipeline execution failed |
| `STORAGE_ERROR` | 500 | File persistence failed |
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected error |

---

## Storage

Uploaded files are persisted to:

* Input files: storage/jobs/<job_id>/inputs/
* Generated output: storage/jobs/<job_id>/outputs/
* SQLite job database: storage/jobs/jobs.db

The `storage/` directory is gitignored.

The API keeps the physical filesystem path and HTTP download URL separate:

* `output_path` — physical filesystem path of the generated MP4.
* `output_url` — HTTP API URL used to download the generated MP4.

For a completed job, the canonical output URL is:

`/api/v1/outputs/<job_id>/outputs/avatar.mp4`

The SQLite database is the persistent source of truth for job state, so completed job records remain available after the service restarts.


## Setup Instructions

### Local Development (Python Virtual Environment)

1. Navigate to this directory:
   ```bash
   cd services/talking-head-service
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Install the official LatentSync runtime from source:
   ```bash
   pip install "git+https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync.git"
   ```
5. Download the official model assets to a local directory such as `./models/latentsync`:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p models/latentsync/checkpoints/whisper
   huggingface-cli download ByteDance/LatentSync-1.6 latentsync_unet.pt --local-dir models/latentsync/checkpoints
   huggingface-cli download ByteDance/LatentSync-1.6 tiny.pt --local-dir models/latentsync/checkpoints/whisper
   ```
   The upstream repo also expects the config directory to include `configs/unet/stage2_512.yaml` and `configs/scheduler_config.json`.
6. Configure the runtime via `.env` or environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
7. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
8. Open `http://localhost:8000/docs` for the OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation.

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d talking-head-service
```

### Official LatentSync model files

The repository is designed to use the official LatentSync checkpoint set from the
upstream project:

- `checkpoints/latentsync_unet.pt`
- `checkpoints/whisper/tiny.pt` (or small/other Whisper model variant supported by the upstream repo)
- `configs/unet/stage2_512.yaml`
- `configs/scheduler_config.json`

Do not commit these files or multi-GB model weights to the repository. Keep them
under a local `MODEL_CACHE_DIR` or `LATENTSYNC_*` location and point the service to
that directory via environment variables.

## Pipeline Behaviour (Current)

The `run_talking_head_pipeline()` function is the integration boundary where real
Talking Head model inference will be invoked (e.g. LatentSync — see Issue #2).

Currently, no inference engine, model weights, or checkpoints exist in this
repository. Instead of raising a raw `NotImplementedError`, the pipeline performs
a **controlled failure**:

1. Sets job status → `processing`
2. Raises `PipelineError` (domain exception, not an unhandled crash)
3. Catches the error and sets job status → `failed` with a descriptive `error_message`

This is intentional and production-safe. No fake video is generated and no job is
falsely marked `completed`.

## Job Management & Storage
Job state is managed persistently using a SQLite database (`jobs.db`) located in the root `storage/` directory. 
* **Database:** Stores job metadata, status, progress, and URLs (`storage/jobs.db`).
* **Outputs:** Video files are saved in `storage/{job_id}/outputs/`.
When the server restarts, job histories and physical video outputs remain intact and accessible.
